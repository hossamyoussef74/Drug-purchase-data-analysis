# **Pharmaceutical Purchase Data Analysis using Python & Power BI**  

## **Project Overview**  
In this project, I analyzed **pharmaceutical purchase data** to help a company optimize its procurement process. Since I couldn't find suitable datasets on platforms like **Kaggle**, I generated a synthetic dataset using **Python (pandas, random)**, creating **5,000 rows** to simulate real-world transactions.  

The analysis focused on evaluating employee performance, supplier efficiency, and demand trends to improve purchasing decisions. I used **Power BI** for interactive data visualization and insights extraction.  

## **Objectives**  
ðŸ”¹ **Assess Employee Performance:** Identify which employees secure the best supplier discounts.  
ðŸ”¹ **Compare Suppliers:** Evaluate suppliers based on **order quality and delivery speed**.  
ðŸ”¹ **Analyze Product Demand:** Determine which medicines have the highest demand.  
ðŸ”¹ **Optimize Procurement Decisions:** Select the best supplier offering **higher discounts, better quality, and faster delivery**, leading to increased profits and reduced losses.  

## **Tools & Technologies**  
ðŸ›  **Python (pandas, random)** â€“ Data generation and processing  
ðŸ“Š **Power BI** â€“ Data visualization and insights extraction  

## **Key Insights**  
âœ… Employees who achieved the highest discounts  
âœ… Fastest and most reliable suppliers  
âœ… Most in-demand pharmaceutical products  

By leveraging **data analysis**, businesses can make informed purchasing decisions, leading to **cost savings, higher efficiency, and increased profitability**. ðŸš€
